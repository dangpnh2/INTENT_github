many chemicals environment cause cancer polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs among most ubiquitous
cancer risk assessments require consideration complex mixtures
pahs require metabolic activation cytochrome enzymes primarily
determined individual pahs other procarcinogens affect activities human measuring erod activity metabolic activation pah dihydrodiols genotoxic metabolites salmonella typhimurium system
pahs examined most potent inhibitors erod activity values nm
other pahs rather selectively inhibited values nm
nine other pahs inhibited well values nm
parent pah compounds generally more potent dihydrodiol metabolites pahs inhibiting erod activity
addition found three selected pahs inhibited metabolic activation genotoxic metabolites catalyzed respectively typhimurium
thus individual pahs affect metabolism other carcinogens catalyzed cause alteration ability transform cells single complex pah mixtures mammals influencing risk assessment

chemical carcinogens capable inducing tumors rodents without directly altering genetic material
since preponderance evidence suggests cancer results accumulation genetic alterations mechanisms many carcinogens induce genotoxic events remain unclear
present study investigated whether mitogenic carcinogen phenobarbital pb alter checkpoint controls thereby indirectly leading accumulation genetic damage
initial studies involved characterizing checkpoint responses dna damage freshly isolated mouse hepatocytes
arrest coupled protein induction however protein levels remained unchanged
studies utilized hepatocytes isolated mice showed dna arrest dependent function arrest affected loss
pb able delay attenuate checkpoint response without altering checkpoint function
reduction protein transcript levels observed hepatocytes exposed pb
additionally pb delayed attenuated protein induction during dna damage
suggests changes protein contributing attenuated checkpoint response caused pb
altered checkpoint function represents epigenetic mechanism phenobarbital prevent detection repair dna damage indirectly increase frequency genotoxic events above occurring spontaneously
abrogation checkpoint controls thus play important mechanistic role mitogenic chemical carcinogenesis
